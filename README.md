# Hi, I'm Victor Jose Camacho

I'm a senior full-stack engineer with a focus on Ruby on Rails and building scalable, reliable product features end-to-end. I enjoy working in small teams, owning problems from design to deployment, and improving systems through thoughtful architecture, debugging, and optimization.

Over the past decade, I’ve worked across a wide range of areas: billing systems, geospatial search, real-time interfaces, data pipelines, background job orchestration, and integrations of all kinds. I like projects where the problem has depth and the solution requires both technical clarity and good product judgment.
